## Dimensioning a pv system

First rule: minimize load!

Collect realistic data for 
insolation, load, time characteristics, etc

Conservative approach to dimensioning

- Know your load
- Decide how much uptime without recharge you need (longest dark period)
==> Battery Capacity
- Decide how long it may take to recharge the battery
==> Solar panel size


## Dimensioning exercise

### Dimensioning a photovoltaic system: First approximation

You could call this the "battery approach" - we start with
 looking at the total load of consuming devices
 how long we need to keep them running without sun -
 then we calculate the battery capacity and everything else from there.

All numbers here are of course just examples – total load, insolation hours and other factors will be different from case to case!


To start, we need to know two things:
Total Load at 12 Volts [W]: e.g. 20 Watt (==> 1.7 A)
Days of Autonomy, that means: how long we can run without sun: 
we will say 3 days a 8 hours a day ==> 24 hours.
These two lead us to ...
Total Battery Capacity needed [Ah]: 40 = 24 h * 1.7 A

However, no battery should be discharged completely ever - the maximum discharge depends on the type of battery. Read your data sheet!
What is the maximum discharge level of the batteries? e.g. 50%: 50%
With this correction, we get ...
Total Battery Capacity needed [Ah]: 80

Now that we know the battery capacity, we need to know how many days we allow for full recharging, once the sun is shining
Maximum time for recharging [days]: 1
How many hours of sun on an average day? 5
This gives us the total power of the solar panels needed – we will need to have 40/5 A flowing into the battery
We need this many Watts from the 12 Volts panels: 60 Watt!

60 Watt of panels to power 20 Watt of consumer devices, for some of the time.
And we are only using it 8 hours a day, and have not been demanding a long autonomy phase.
For nonstop operations, it would be approximately 200 Watts!
Let us look at the same system from a different angle.

### Dimensioning a photovoltaic system: Second approximation

This is the "worst month approach", simplified. That means, we will
calculate how much energy (power x time) we need per month
take the month with the least sun
see how many solar panels we need to generate the needed energy in that worst month

Again , we need to know the ...
Total Load at 12 Volts [W]: 20
How many hours per day do we need our devices running? 8

this tells us, how many AmpHours will be needed:
Total AmpHours per month: 400  (30 days * 8 hours * 1.7 A)
What are the average sunshine hours in the worst (darkest) month of the year? 
150 (i.e. 5 hours a day ... a sunny climate)

These hours will have to be enough to generate the same amount of AmpHours we found above – this tells us how many watts of solar power we need:
Total Watts of 12 V Solar Panels: 32 Watt

Now we still need to know our battery capacity – again based on:
Days of Autonomy, that means: how long we can run without sun: 3
and
The maximum discharge level of the batteries? 50
This results in
Total Battery Capacity 50 Ah

This second approach leads to a far more optimistic result - only 1/2 of the solar panel power needed.

Discuss!
Why is this the case?
What does the "worst month model" neglect?
